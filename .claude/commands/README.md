## How They Work

- User types `/tdd I need a use case for task prioritization`
- Claude loads the command's markdown file as a prompt
- The command's `description` field in frontmatter helps Claude match it to user intent

## Example

```
User: /tdd I need a GetTasksUseCase
→ Loads tdd.md, launches tdd-guide agent, follows RED-GREEN-REFACTOR cycle

User: /update-docs technical insert new shared module "task-ai"
→ Loads update-docs.md, launches doc-updater agent for technical axis
```

## Adding a New Command

Create `<command-name>.md` with this frontmatter:

```yaml
---
description: One-line description of what this command does.
---

# Command Name

Prompt instructions go here.
```
